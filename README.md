### How to use it?

To use this simple database manager you have to download the file and insert it in your project (maybe a game or a simple app) and use the code to create tables, add, remove, update and delete data in the tables. This code helps you to improve your code and do tasks fast, cause you don't need to create the code to run SQL commands to have your database. In this case, you just need to call the function and pass the required infos like table name, attributes, items you wanna read, etc.

### How good is SQLite?

Python SQLite is a python library developed to help python programmers to create local database more easily, compared with other tools. But this also has some limitations: it is locally, store data request by request, is less secure... That's why SQLite is ideal to small/simple projects.
